# ADR Detect: Comparing LLM Generalization with Embedding-based Models for Adverse Drug Reaction Detection

**Authors**: Nicole Poliak & Naveh Nissan

---

## Overview

Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of patient harm and hospitalization, yet they are often buried in unstructured clinical notes or patient-written reviews. This project explores automated ADR detection from such texts using two different natural language processing (NLP) paradigms:

- **Zero-/Few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- **Sentence Embeddings + Logistic Regression Classifier**

Our aim is to compare their effectiveness in identifying ADRs and evaluate their suitability for scalable, AI-driven medical decision support.

### Requirements

- A GPU runtime (e.g., Google Colab with GPU or local machine with CUDA)
- Access to:
  - An **Azure OpenAI endpoint** + **API key** (for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Phi-4-mini-instruct)
  - A **Hugging Face token** (for LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct)
 
---

## Task Definition

- **Input**: A single sentence from a biomedical abstract or patient review  
- **Output**: Binary label  
  - `1`: ADR present  
  - `0`: No ADR present  
- **Task**: Sentence-level binary classification (ADR vs. Non-ADR)

## Datasets

We used two publicly available datasets:

| Dataset        | Description                                      | Size     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **ADE Corpus V2** | Expert-annotated PubMed sentences on drug events | 23,516   |
| **PsyTAR**     | Patient-written drug reviews from AskAPatient    | 6,009    |
| **Combined**   | Merged, cleaned, deduplicated dataset             | 26,867 → 12,862 after downsampling |

Each entry has:
- `text`: the sentence
- `label`: binary (1 = ADR, 0 = Non-ADR)
- `dataset`: source origin (ADE or PsyTAR)

> Due to class imbalance (~24% ADR), downsampling was applied to the majority class.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Final size after balancing**: 6,431 ADR + 6,431 Non-ADR = 12,862 total  
- **Average sentence length**: 17.2 words  
- **Duplicates removed**: 2,639  
- **Total words**: 462,108  
- **Total characters**: 2.6M+  

Text preprocessing included:
- Lowercasing  
- Punctuation removal  
- Rechecking duplicates  

---
## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy** – Overall classification performance  
- **Precision** – How many predicted ADRs were correct  
- **Recall** – How many true ADRs were identified (most important for safety)  
- **F1-Score** – Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix - Test Set** – Shows counts of correct and incorrect predictions across ADR and non-ADR classes.
- **ROC-AUC - Test Set** – Area under ROC curve (BoW + embedding models only)

## Insights 

- **Models prioritizing recall** are most suitable for ADR detection to avoid missing critical cases (e.g., GPT-4o Zero-Shot).  
- **ChatGPT-4 models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini)** consistently delivered the strongest performance across both zero-shot and few-shot setups.  
- **Performance varied across models** - some LLMs outperformed embeddings, while others did not.  
- **BoW + Naive Bayes** served as a solid traditional baseline, but were clearly outperformed by modern LLMs and embedding-based models.  
- **Prompting strategy impacted performance** - prompts were adjusted multiple times to improve results; even small wording changes can significantly    affect the precision–recall tradeoff.
- **Tuning the number of few-shot examples per model** was necessary to achieve decent results, reinforcing that more examples don’t always help.  
- **Zero-shot often outperformed few-shot**, showing that giving examples doesn't always lead to better results.  
- **BioBERT + Logistic Regression** had the best evaluation scores among all the embedding models (F1 = 0.82).
- **LLaMA underperformed**, likely due to the lack of fine-tuning or use of enhanced LLaMA variants seen in prior research. It also produced a high      rate of invalid responses (14%), suggesting that the model is sensitive to certain input formats or phrasing.
